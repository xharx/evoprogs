Platform für evolutionäre Programmismem - Evolutionary Programmisms Platform

	evoprogs. Virtual machines running in a world simulation.  The machines are called agents, they run programs in a kiss-
	environemt, the world. The matrix. Keep it simple, stupid. Add more and more physics later, if you like to.  The agents are also called
	evolutionary programmisms and often has been said, they are unlimited, they are uncontrollable. Call it hybris or call it
	irony. The programs can achive any imaginable functionality. The computer language the use is just another implementation of a
	universal computing language as they have been invented in unseen numbers since electrons fulfil these strange vibrations in cages,
	representing numbers. The agents have been started and will run until they are stopped. Next, they will travel over the net.
